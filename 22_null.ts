/* NULL :

  *Null refers to a value that is either empty or a value that doesn’t exist. It’s on purpose that there’s no value here.

  *TypeScript does not make a variable null by default.

  *Typescript uses null to represent variables that have an absence of values or no value assigned to them in short.

// Example 1: Assigning null to values

let str:string;
str=null,
//prints undefined
console.log(str);
